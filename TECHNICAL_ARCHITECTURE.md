# KraftAI Technical Architecture

## System Overview
KraftAI uses a modern web architecture with AI-powered backend services to transform craft images into comprehensive marketing content.

## Architecture Components

### Frontend Layer
- **Technology:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+
- **Features:** Responsive design, drag-drop uploads, real-time content preview
- **Hosting:** Firebase Hosting (gen-ai-hackathon-472505.web.app)

### Backend Layer
- **Technology:** Node.js with Express framework
- **Key Libraries:** Multer (file handling), CORS, Helmet (security)
- **Hosting:** Google App Engine with auto-scaling

### AI/ML Layer
- **Google Vision API:** Image analysis, object detection, text recognition
- **Google Gemini AI:** Natural language generation, content creation
- **Custom Logic:** Cultural heritage matching, market trend integration

### Data Layer
- **Cultural Heritage Database:** Traditional craft knowledge, regional information
- **Market Trends Database:** Pricing data, seasonal patterns, target demographics
- **Caching:** Node-cache for improved performance

## Data Flow
1. User uploads craft image via frontend
2. Express backend receives image and form data
3. Vision API analyzes image for craft type, materials, complexity
4. System matches analysis with cultural heritage database
5. Gemini AI generates content using cultural context
6. Market intelligence adds pricing and trend analysis
7. Formatted response returned to frontend
8. User receives comprehensive marketing content

## Security Measures
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- File size and type validation
- CORS configuration for secure cross-origin requests
- Environment variable-based credential management
- Helmet.js security headers

## Scalability Design
- Auto-scaling App Engine configuration
- Stateless backend architecture
- Efficient image processing with memory management
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Load balancing through Google Cloud infrastructure

## Performance Optimizations
- Image compression before processing
- Asynchronous API calls
- Connection pooling
- Response caching
- CDN delivery for static assets
